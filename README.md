# Connect Four

From [Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four): 

Connect Four (also known as Connect 4, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Captain's Mistress, Four in a Row, Drop Four, and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union) is a game in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a six-row, seven-column vertically suspended grid. 


## Assignment

This project was build by implementing TDD(Test-Driven-Development)

## Thoughts

This project was definitely hard, much harder than previous one.
When I was trying to keep it TDD I encountered number of problems:
1. After writing tests, method fails.
 - I would not say that that I wasn't expecting it, but my tests were failing one after another, eventually I managed to get over it and make my methods to pass, after googling, rereading rspec lesson, and using other methods.
2. Method works, but my test is the one that is wrong
 - This one was quite shocking, I did not know what to do, because when I tested method in [Replit] (replit.com), it was working without errors but the test method was the one that was wrong. So I had to spend a lot of time trying to rewrite my test methods.
3. There is not much information about connect four in Ruby, so I had do look up for other languages like Java, Python, Js and how they implemented it. 
  - Maybe it is I who lacks something, but because of googling and looking for help in the internet (even asking AI, yes) this challenging project was completed. AND BY NO MEANS this version of project is perfect, but hey, it is something if it works.
